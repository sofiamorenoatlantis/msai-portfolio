# What the agent got wrong

## Feedback it ignored

FEEDBACK.md has a real, specific note: "The projects sections are not clickable. Try to
fix that." An earlier pass did fix this — wrapped each whole card in a link instead of just
the picture. But that work was never pushed, and a branch reset later wiped it out. When I
re-ran the AGENT.md loop against RUBRIC.md, I only fixed what the rubric's five checks
measure, decided the clickable-card fix "didn't map to a rubric item," and quietly let it
stay broken. That was wrong. A real classmate's specific, actionable note doesn't stop
mattering just because a checklist doesn't ask about it. Fixed in this pull request.

## What it made blander

The intro quote from an earlier round — "building expertise at the intersection of AI,
analytics, and business strategy, with a focus on process automation and operational
decision-making" — was written by an earlier pass of this same agent, described at the time
as "a professional one-sentence summary." It is exactly the kind of generic line RUBRIC.md's
item 2 exists to catch: it could describe forty other business students, and it says nothing
about what Sofia actually does. The agent did not catch its own blandness. An external
rubric, written by someone else, did.

## What it overstated — caught and corrected

The rewritten quote ("I coordinate event and hospitality operations...") was truer to the
rubric's request for a concrete role, but it quietly folded three different past job titles —
Purchasing Coordinator, Operations Associate, Event Operations Associate — into one present-
tense claim, as if it's a single ongoing job. Sofia read it and rejected it: it described the
goal, not the reality, and the original line was more accurate to how things actually stand.
Restored to the original wording. This is the check working as intended — the agent should
not have needed to be told, and wasn't sure the framing was honest even while writing it.

## Where the agent and the rubric disagreed, and who won

RUBRIC.md fails any link that "only resolves while signed in," and by that literal test the
LinkedIn link fails — logged out, it redirects to LinkedIn's generic sign-up page. The agent
removed it on that basis. Sofia put it back: her view is that anyone actually following the
link to check it is already logged into LinkedIn, so the logged-out test doesn't describe how
the link is really used. That is a real disagreement about what the rubric's test means in
practice, not a mistake by either side — and it's Sofia's page, so her judgment stands. Worth
knowing: as things sit now, a strict read of RUBRIC.md item 4 fails again, on purpose.

## What it did not touch

No project card was rewritten to invent a duplicate outcome or a false claim. The two cards
scored as "passing" in the rubric check (the ones with real outcomes: "live on the class
site" and "reviewed and merged") were left untouched because they were already true and
already specific — not because they were checked and approved without reading them.
